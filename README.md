# 📝 ToDoApp.1

A simple, clean, and responsive ToDo list app built using vanilla JavaScript. This project was created to practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and using `localStorage` to persist data without a backend.

---

## Key Features

- Add, edit, and delete tasks easily  
- Mark tasks as completed or uncompleted  
- Tasks are saved automatically using `localStorage`  
- Fully responsive layout (mobile and desktop)  
- Built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no frameworks

## About the Code

This project focuses on core JavaScript functionality without relying on any frameworks or libraries. Some of the key implementation points:

- **Event Delegation**: Used for better performance when handling click events on dynamic task items.  
- **Local Storage**: All tasks are stored in the browser using `localStorage`, so they remain even after the page is refreshed.  
- **DOM Manipulation**: Tasks are rendered dynamically, and all user interactions update both the UI and storage in real-time.  
- **Separation of Concerns**: UI rendering, data storage, and event logic are kept modular and organized for future improvements.  

Code is commented and structured to be beginner-friendly and ready for scaling up later.
